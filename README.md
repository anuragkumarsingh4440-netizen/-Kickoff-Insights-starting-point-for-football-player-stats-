# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This repository contains an **end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project**, where I performed data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and insight generation. The goal is to demonstrate how raw datasets can be transformed into meaningful insights using statistical methods, visualization, and dashboarding.

## 🔥 Overview
EDA is a critical first step in data science. It involves summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, identifying patterns, handling missing values, detecting outliers, and visualizing distributions and relationships between variables.  
This project demonstrates those steps and presents insights using both **Python** and **Tableau**.

## 📊 Topics Covered
- Classification of data (categorical, numerical, ordinal, nominal)  
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, std, IQR)  
- Distribution & shape (skewness, kurtosis)  
- Handling missing values and outliers  
- Feature engineering and transformation  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Feature scaling (normalization & standardization)  
- Data visualization:
  - Univariate analysis (histogram, boxplot, pie chart)  
  - Bivariate/multivariate analysis (scatterplot, heatmap, bar chart)  
  - Dashboarding (Tableau / Power BI)

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Load and clean datasets  
- Apply descriptive statistics for summarization  
- Handle missing values and outliers systematically  
- Engineer and scale features for further analysis  
- Visualize relationships and discover trends  
- Build interactive dashboards for business insights
