# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ‚Äî 5-Day Crash Course

**Course:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
**Duration:** 5 Days  
**Audience:** Aspiring Data & Business Analysts  
**Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn), Excel, Tableau, Power BI (optional)

---

## üî• Course Overview
A practical, hands-on 5-day course that teaches end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis. By the end of the course you will be able to read data from multiple sources, clean and preprocess it, visualize it using charts, engineer features, and present business insights with an interactive dashboard.

---

## üß≠ Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of spreadsheets (Excel)  
- Basic familiarity with Python or willingness to follow along (not mandatory for Tableau-only path)  
- Laptop with Python (3.7+) and Jupyter / VS Code or Tableau Public installed

---

## üìÖ Syllabus (Day-wise)

### Day 1 ‚Äî Introduction to EDA
**Topics**
- Classification of data (numerical, categorical, ordinal, nominal)  
- Reading data from CSV/Excel/SQL  
- Understanding variables (features & target)  
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode)  
- Measures of dispersion (variance, std, IQR)  
- Distribution & shape (skewness, kurtosis)

**Outcomes**
- Classify data types and pick correct statistical summaries  
- Compute and interpret central tendency & dispersion

---

### Day 2 ‚Äî Analysis Through Visualization
**Topics**
- Understand the business problem & KPIs  
- Data type conversion & handling categorical variables  
- Bivariate analysis:
  - Quantitative vs Quantitative (scatter, corr, regression line)
  - Quantitative vs Categorical (boxplot, violin)
  - Categorical vs Categorical (stacked bar, mosaic)

**Outcomes**
- Transform tabular data into meaningful charts  
- Choose the right chart for relationships

---

### Day 3 ‚Äî Data Preprocessing
**Topics**
- Missing value treatment (drop/impute with mean/median/mode/forward-fill)  
- Outlier detection & treatment (Z-score, IQR)  
- Feature engineering basics (date features, binning, domain transforms)

**Outcomes**
- Clean datasets effectively and handle outliers  
- Create new features to boost insight & model performance

---

### Day 4 ‚Äî Feature Engineering & Scaling
**Topics**
- Encoding non-numeric data (one-hot, label, ordinal)  
- Feature scaling (normalization vs standardization)  
- Data transformations (log, sqrt, Box-Cox)

**Outcomes**
- Convert categorical features for modeling  
- Scale/transform features appropriately for algorithms

---

### Day 5 ‚Äî Case Study & Interview Prep
**Topics**
- End-to-end EDA case study (from raw data to insights)  
- Building a dashboard (Tableau / Power BI)  
- Common interview questions & hands-on problem solving

**Outcomes**
- Complete an EDA workflow and present insights  
- Practice interview-style questions & answers

---

## üéØ Core Learning Outcomes (What you'll be able to do)
- Read and clean real-world datasets from multiple sources  
- Perform descriptive statistics and detect distribution shapes  
- Visualize univariate, bivariate and multivariate relationships  
- Engineer features and prepare data for modeling  
- Build an interactive dashboard and communicate insights effectively
